# API-
- API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allow two software applications to communicate with each other.

# API Gateway-
- API Gateway is a fully managed service that helps you create, publish, secure, and monitor APIs at any scale.
- It acts as a front door for applications to access data, business logic, or services running on AWS (like Lambda, EC2) or any backend.


## Types of API-
### 1] REST API-
- REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a style of API that allows clients (like mobile apps, web apps, or services) to communicate with a server using standard HTTP methods.
- REST API handles every request independently.

| Method     | Purpose              |
|----------- |-----------------------|
| **GET**    | Fetch data            |
| **POST**   | Create new data       |
| **PUT**    | Update existing data  |
| **DELETE** | Delete data           |
| **PATCH**  | Partial update        |

### 2] WebSocket API- 
- WebSocket API Gateway enables real-time, two-way communication between clients (like web apps, mobile apps) and your backend.
- Unlike REST or HTTP APIs (which are request–response), WebSocket APIs keep a persistent connection open so both sides can send data anytime.
